## DBGBOARD - a console-based debug board 
Main advantages over the old board:
* Bigger font
* Scrolling (like in other console apps)
* K : and L: messages highligting

Also, like the old board it writes log to /tmp0/1/boardlog.txt (or you can pass another path in args like `/sys/develop/dbgboard /tmp0/1/hgfdhgfh.txt`), you can view log file in cedit by hitting `F2` key
