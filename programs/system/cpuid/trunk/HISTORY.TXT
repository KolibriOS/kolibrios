;"To do" plans:
; actual use of Brand ID for description of Intel's CPU, i.e. Celeron/Pentium separation;
; remove support of Cyrix and early Centaur (IDT)  - they are too old, rare and non-standard;
; Sempron detection - probably they supports Brand-ID;
; update caches descriptors for intel Core 1/2
; quantity of logical CPU/cores - requires APIC ID analysis
; newest AMD/Intel codename detection
; improve support of Vortex86

;          (+)  fixed typo, which makes selection of incorrect codename for AMD F8x CPU's; 
;          (+)  added detection of Extended Model for Intel's CPU and example of it's use
;Known issues: Sempron marked as AthlonXP
;              second window doesn't closed when you close main window
;              incorrect multiplier detection for newest CPU
;              incorrect cache detection for several models of newest Intel CPU, because they designed for another cache detection approach

;          (+)  new caches for Intel
;          (+)  fixed Celeron detection based on L2 cache size for newest Intel CPU (there are Celeron models with 512 Kb);
;          (+)  CPUID now display System Clock with accuracy 0.01 MHz;
;          (+)  new logo for Intel (they changed it some time ago);
