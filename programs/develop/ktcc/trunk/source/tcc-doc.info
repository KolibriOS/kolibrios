1 Introduction
**************

TinyCC (aka TCC) is a small but hyper fast C compiler. Unlike other C
compilers, it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an external
assembler or linker because TCC does that for you.

   TCC compiles so _fast_ that even for big projects `Makefile's may
not be necessary.

   TCC not only supports ANSI C, but also most of the new ISO C99
standard and many GNUC extensions including inline assembly.

   TCC can also be used to make _C scripts_, i.e. pieces of C source
that you run as a Perl or Python script. Compilation is so fast that
your script will be as fast as if it was an executable.

   TCC can also automatically generate memory and bound checks (*note
Bounds::) while allowing all C pointers operations. TCC can do these
checks even if non patched libraries are used.

   With `libtcc', you can use TCC as a backend for dynamic code
generation (*note Libtcc::).

   TCC mainly supports the i386 target on Linux and Windows. There are
alpha ports for the ARM (`arm-tcc') and the TMS320C67xx targets
(`c67-tcc'). More information about the ARM port is available at
`http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2003-10/msg00044.html'.

   For usage on Windows, see also `tcc-win32.txt'.

2 Command line invocation
*************************

2.1 Quick start
===============

     usage: tcc [options] [INFILE1 INFILE2...] [`-run' INFILE ARGS...]

TCC options are a very much like gcc options. The main difference is
that TCC can also execute directly the resulting program and give it
runtime arguments.

   Here are some examples to understand the logic:

``tcc -run a.c''
     Compile `a.c' and execute it directly

``tcc -run a.c arg1''
     Compile a.c and execute it directly. arg1 is given as first
     argument to the `main()' of a.c.

``tcc a.c -run b.c arg1''
     Compile `a.c' and `b.c', link them together and execute them. arg1
     is given as first argument to the `main()' of the resulting
     program.

``tcc -o myprog a.c b.c''
     Compile `a.c' and `b.c', link them and generate the executable
     `myprog'.

``tcc -o myprog a.o b.o''
     link `a.o' and `b.o' together and generate the executable `myprog'.

``tcc -c a.c''
     Compile `a.c' and generate object file `a.o'.

``tcc -c asmfile.S''
     Preprocess with C preprocess and assemble `asmfile.S' and generate
     object file `asmfile.o'.

``tcc -c asmfile.s''
     Assemble (but not preprocess) `asmfile.s' and generate object file
     `asmfile.o'.

``tcc -r -o ab.o a.c b.c''
     Compile `a.c' and `b.c', link them together and generate the
     object file `ab.o'.


   Scripting:

   TCC can be invoked from _scripts_, just as shell scripts. You just
need to add `#!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run' at the start of your C source:

     #!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main()
     {
         printf("Hello World\n");
         return 0;
     }

   TCC can read C source code from _standard input_ when `-' is used in
place of `infile'. Example:

     echo 'main(){puts("hello");}' | tcc -run -

2.2 Option summary
==================

General Options:

`-c'
     Generate an object file.

`-o outfile'
     Put object file, executable, or dll into output file `outfile'.

`-run source [args...]'
     Compile file SOURCE and run it with the command line arguments
     ARGS. In order to be able to give more than one argument to a
     script, several TCC options can be given _after_ the `-run'
     option, separated by spaces:
          tcc "-run -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11" ex4.c
     In a script, it gives the following header:
          #!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11

`-mfloat-abi (ARM only)'
     Select the float ABI. Possible values: `softfp' and `hard'

`-dumpversion'
     Print only the compiler version and nothing else.

`-v'
     Display TCC version.

`-vv'
     Show included files.  As sole argument, print search dirs (as
     below).

`-bench'
     Display compilation statistics.

`-print-search-dirs'
     Print the configured installation directory and a list of library
     and include directories tcc will search.


   Preprocessor options:

`-Idir'
     Specify an additional include path. Include paths are searched in
     the order they are specified.

     System include paths are always searched after. The default system
     include paths are: `/usr/local/include', `/usr/include' and
     `PREFIX/lib/tcc/include'. (`PREFIX' is usually `/usr' or
     `/usr/local').

`-Dsym[=val]'
     Define preprocessor symbol `sym' to val. If val is not present,
     its value is `1'. Function-like macros can also be defined:
     `-DF(a)=a+1'

`-Usym'
     Undefine preprocessor symbol `sym'.

   Compilation flags:

   Note: each of the following options has a negative form beginning
with `-fno-'.

`-funsigned-char'
     Let the `char' type be unsigned.

`-fsigned-char'
     Let the `char' type be signed.

`-fno-common'
     Do not generate common symbols for uninitialized data.

`-fleading-underscore'
     Add a leading underscore at the beginning of each C symbol.

`-fms-extensions'
     Allow a MS C compiler extensions to the language. Curretly this
     assume a nested named structure declaration without identifier
     behave like an unnamed one.

`-fdollars-in-identifiers'
     Allow a dollars in identifiers.

`-fnormalize-inc-dirs'
     Be more gcc compatible and remove non-existent or duplicate
     directories from include paths. This helps to compile such
     packages as coreutils.


   Warning options:

`-w'
     Disable all warnings.


   Note: each of the following warning options has a negative form
beginning with `-Wno-'.

`-Wimplicit-function-declaration'
     Warn about implicit function declaration.

`-Wunsupported'
     Warn about unsupported GCC features that are ignored by TCC.

`-Wwrite-strings'
     Make string constants be of type `const char *' instead of `char
     *'.

`-Werror'
     Abort compilation if warnings are issued.

`-Wall'
     Activate all warnings, except `-Werror', `-Wunusupported' and
     `-Wwrite-strings'.


   Linker options:

`-Ldir'
     Specify an additional static library path for the `-l' option. The
     default library paths are `/usr/local/lib', `/usr/lib' and `/lib'.

`-lxxx'
     Link your program with dynamic library libxxx.so or static library
     libxxx.a. The library is searched in the paths specified by the
     `-L' option and `LIBRARY_PATH' variable.

`-Bdir'
     Set the path where the tcc internal libraries (and include files)
     can be found (default is `PREFIX/lib/tcc').

`-shared'
     Generate a shared library instead of an executable.

`-soname name'
     set name for shared library to be used at runtime

`-static'
     Generate a statically linked executable (default is a shared linked
     executable).

`-rdynamic'
     Export global symbols to the dynamic linker. It is useful when a
     library opened with `dlopen()' needs to access executable symbols.

`-r'
     Generate an object file combining all input files.

`-Wl,-rpath=path'
     Put custom seatch path for dynamic libraries into executable.

`-Wl,--oformat=fmt'
     Use FMT as output format. The supported output formats are:
    `elf32-i386'
          ELF output format (default)

    `binary'
          Binary image (only for executable output)

    `coff'
          COFF output format (only for executable output for
          TMS320C67xx target)

`-Wl,-subsystem=console/gui/wince/...'
     Set type for PE (Windows) executables.

`-Wl,-[Ttext=# | section-alignment=# | file-alignment=# | image-base=# | stack=#]'
     Modify executable layout.

`-Wl,-Bsymbolic'
     Set DT_SYMBOLIC tag.


   Debugger options:

`-g'
     Generate run time debug information so that you get clear run time
     error messages: ` test.c:68: in function 'test5()': dereferencing
     invalid pointer' instead of the laconic `Segmentation fault'.

`-b'
     Generate additional support code to check memory allocations and
     array/pointer bounds. `-g' is implied. Note that the generated
     code is slower and bigger in this case.

     Note: `-b' is only available on i386 when using libtcc for the
     moment.

`-bt N'
     Display N callers in stack traces. This is useful with `-g' or
     `-b'.


   Misc options:

`-MD'
     Generate makefile fragment with dependencies.

`-MF depfile'
     Use `depfile' as output for -MD.


   Note: GCC options `-Ox', `-fx' and `-mx' are ignored.

   Environment variables that affect how tcc operates.

`CPATH'

`C_INCLUDE_PATH'
     A colon-separated list of directories searched for include files,
     directories given with `-I' are searched first.

`LIBRARY_PATH'
     A colon-separated list of directories searched for libraries for
     the `-l' option, directories given with `-L' are searched first.

3 C language support
********************

3.1 ANSI C
==========

TCC implements all the ANSI C standard, including structure bit fields
and floating point numbers (`long double', `double', and `float' fully
supported).

3.2 ISOC99 extensions
=====================

TCC implements many features of the new C standard: ISO C99. Currently
missing items are: complex and imaginary numbers.

   Currently implemented ISOC99 features:

   * variable length arrays.

   * 64 bit `long long' types are fully supported.

   * The boolean type `_Bool' is supported.

   * `__func__' is a string variable containing the current function
     name.

   * Variadic macros: `__VA_ARGS__' can be used for    function-like
     macros:
              #define dprintf(level, __VA_ARGS__) printf(__VA_ARGS__)

     `dprintf' can then be used with a variable number of parameters.

   * Declarations can appear anywhere in a block (as in C++).

   * Array and struct/union elements can be initialized in any order by
      using designators:
              struct { int x, y; } st[10] = { [0].x = 1, [0].y = 2 };

              int tab[10] = { 1, 2, [5] = 5, [9] = 9};

   * Compound initializers are supported:
              int *p = (int []){ 1, 2, 3 };
     to initialize a pointer pointing to an initialized array. The same
     works for structures and strings.

   * Hexadecimal floating point constants are supported:
                    double d = 0x1234p10;

     is the same as writing
                    double d = 4771840.0;

   * `inline' keyword is ignored.

   * `restrict' keyword is ignored.

3.3 GNU C extensions
====================

TCC implements some GNU C extensions:

   * array designators can be used without '=':
              int a[10] = { [0] 1, [5] 2, 3, 4 };

   * Structure field designators can be a label:
              struct { int x, y; } st = { x: 1, y: 1};
     instead of
              struct { int x, y; } st = { .x = 1, .y = 1};

   * `\e' is ASCII character 27.

   * case ranges : ranges can be used in `case's:
              switch(a) {
              case 1 ... 9:
                    printf("range 1 to 9\n");
                    break;
              default:
                    printf("unexpected\n");
                    break;
              }

   * The keyword `__attribute__' is handled to specify variable or
     function attributes. The following attributes are supported:
        * `aligned(n)': align a variable or a structure field to n bytes
          (must be a power of two).

        * `packed': force alignment of a variable or a structure field
          to   1.

        * `section(name)': generate function or data in assembly section
          name (name is a string containing the section name) instead
          of the default section.

        * `unused': specify that the variable or the function is unused.

        * `cdecl': use standard C calling convention (default).

        * `stdcall': use Pascal-like calling convention.

        * `regparm(n)': use fast i386 calling convention. N must be
          between 1 and 3. The first N function parameters are
          respectively put in registers `%eax', `%edx' and `%ecx'.

        * `dllexport': export function from dll/executable (win32 only)


     Here are some examples:
              int a __attribute__ ((aligned(8), section(".mysection")));

     align variable `a' to 8 bytes and put it in section `.mysection'.

              int my_add(int a, int b) __attribute__ ((section(".mycodesection")))
              {
                  return a + b;
              }

     generate function `my_add' in section `.mycodesection'.

   * GNU style variadic macros:
              #define dprintf(fmt, args...) printf(fmt, ## args)

              dprintf("no arg\n");
              dprintf("one arg %d\n", 1);

   * `__FUNCTION__' is interpreted as C99 `__func__' (so it has not
     exactly the same semantics as string literal GNUC where it is a
     string literal).

   * The `__alignof__' keyword can be used as `sizeof' to get the
     alignment of a type or an expression.

   * The `typeof(x)' returns the type of `x'.  `x' is an expression or
     a type.

   * Computed gotos: `&&label' returns a pointer of type `void *' on
     the goto label `label'. `goto *expr' can be used to jump on the
     pointer resulting from `expr'.

   * Inline assembly with asm instruction: 
          static inline void * my_memcpy(void * to, const void * from, size_t n)
          {
          int d0, d1, d2;
          __asm__ __volatile__(
                  "rep ; movsl\n\t"
                  "testb $2,%b4\n\t"
                  "je 1f\n\t"
                  "movsw\n"
                  "1:\ttestb $1,%b4\n\t"
                  "je 2f\n\t"
                  "movsb\n"
                  "2:"
                  : "=&c" (d0), "=&D" (d1), "=&S" (d2)
                  :"0" (n/4), "q" (n),"1" ((long) to),"2" ((long) from)
                  : "memory");
          return (to);
          }

     TCC includes its own x86 inline assembler with a `gas'-like (GNU
     assembler) syntax. No intermediate files are generated. GCC 3.x
     named operands are supported.

   * `__builtin_types_compatible_p()' and `__builtin_constant_p()' are
     supported.

   * `#pragma pack' is supported for win32 compatibility.


3.4 TinyCC extensions
=====================

   * `__TINYC__' is a predefined macro to indicate that you use TCC.

   * `#!' at the start of a line is ignored to allow scripting.

   * Binary digits can be entered (`0b101' instead of `5').

   * `__BOUNDS_CHECKING_ON' is defined if bound checking is activated.

4 TinyCC Assembler
******************

Since version 0.9.16, TinyCC integrates its own assembler. TinyCC
assembler supports a gas-like syntax (GNU assembler). You can
desactivate assembler support if you want a smaller TinyCC executable
(the C compiler does not rely on the assembler).

   TinyCC Assembler is used to handle files with `.S' (C preprocessed
assembler) and `.s' extensions. It is also used to handle the GNU
inline assembler with the `asm' keyword.

4.1 Syntax
==========

TinyCC Assembler supports most of the gas syntax. The tokens are the
same as C.

   * C and C++ comments are supported.

   * Identifiers are the same as C, so you cannot use '.' or '$'.

   * Only 32 bit integer numbers are supported.


4.2 Expressions
===============

   * Integers in decimal, octal and hexa are supported.

   * Unary operators: +, -, ~.

   * Binary operators in decreasing priority order:

       1. *, /, %

       2. &, |, ^

       3. +, -

   * A value is either an absolute number or a label plus an offset.
     All operators accept absolute values except '+' and '-'. '+' or
     '-' can be used to add an offset to a label. '-' supports two
     labels only if they are the same or if they are both defined and
     in the same section.


4.3 Labels
==========

   * All labels are considered as local, except undefined ones.

   * Numeric labels can be used as local `gas'-like labels.  They can
     be defined several times in the same source. Use 'b' (backward) or
     'f' (forward) as suffix to reference them:

           1:
                jmp 1b /* jump to '1' label before */
                jmp 1f /* jump to '1' label after */
           1:


4.4 Directives
==============

All directives are preceded by a '.'. The following directives are
supported:

   * .align n[,value]

   * .skip n[,value]

   * .space n[,value]

   * .byte value1[,...]

   * .word value1[,...]

   * .short value1[,...]

   * .int value1[,...]

   * .long value1[,...]

   * .quad immediate_value1[,...]

   * .globl symbol

   * .global symbol

   * .section section

   * .text

   * .data

   * .bss

   * .fill repeat[,size[,value]]

   * .org n

   * .previous

   * .string string[,...]

   * .asciz string[,...]

   * .ascii string[,...]

4.5 X86 Assembler
=================

All X86 opcodes are supported. Only ATT syntax is supported (source
then destination operand order). If no size suffix is given, TinyCC
tries to guess it from the operand sizes.

   Currently, MMX opcodes are supported but not SSE ones.

5 TinyCC Linker
***************

5.1 ELF file generation
=======================

TCC can directly output relocatable ELF files (object files),
executable ELF files and dynamic ELF libraries without relying on an
external linker.

   Dynamic ELF libraries can be output but the C compiler does not
generate position independent code (PIC). It means that the dynamic
library code generated by TCC cannot be factorized among processes yet.

   TCC linker eliminates unreferenced object code in libraries. A
single pass is done on the object and library list, so the order in
which object files and libraries are specified is important (same
constraint as GNU ld). No grouping options (`--start-group' and
`--end-group') are supported.

5.2 ELF file loader
===================

TCC can load ELF object files, archives (.a files) and dynamic
libraries (.so).

5.3 PE-i386 file generation
===========================

TCC for Windows supports the native Win32 executable file format
(PE-i386).  It generates EXE files (console and gui) and DLL files.

   For usage on Windows, see also tcc-win32.txt.

5.4 GNU Linker Scripts
======================

Because on many Linux systems some dynamic libraries (such as
`/usr/lib/libc.so') are in fact GNU ld link scripts (horrible!), the
TCC linker also supports a subset of GNU ld scripts.

   The `GROUP' and `FILE' commands are supported. `OUTPUT_FORMAT' and

6 TinyCC Memory and Bound checks
********************************

This feature is activated with the `-b' (*note Invoke::).

   Note that pointer size is _unchanged_ and that code generated with
bound checks is _fully compatible_ with unchecked code. When a pointer
comes from unchecked code, it is assumed to be valid. Even very obscure
C code with casts should work correctly.

   For more information about the ideas behind this method, see
`http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/BoundsChecking.html'.

   Here are some examples of caught errors:

Invalid range with standard string function:
          {
              char tab[10];
              memset(tab, 0, 11);
          }

Out of bounds-error in global or local arrays:
          {
              int tab[10];
              for(i=0;i<11;i++) {
                  sum += tab[i];
              }
          }

Out of bounds-error in malloc'ed data:
          {
              int *tab;
              tab = malloc(20 * sizeof(int));
              for(i=0;i<21;i++) {
                  sum += tab4[i];
              }
              free(tab);
          }

Access of freed memory:
          {
              int *tab;
              tab = malloc(20 * sizeof(int));
              free(tab);
              for(i=0;i<20;i++) {
                  sum += tab4[i];
              }
          }

Double free:
          {
              int *tab;
              tab = malloc(20 * sizeof(int));
              free(tab);
              free(tab);
          }

7 The `libtcc' library
**********************

The `libtcc' library enables you to use TCC as a backend for dynamic
code generation.

   Read the `libtcc.h' to have an overview of the API. Read
`libtcc_test.c' to have a very simple example.

   The idea consists in giving a C string containing the program you
want to compile directly to `libtcc'. Then you can access to any global
symbol (function or variable) defined.

8 Developer's guide
*******************

This chapter gives some hints to understand how TCC works. You can skip
it if you do not intend to modify the TCC code.

8.1 File reading
================

The `BufferedFile' structure contains the context needed to read a
file, including the current line number. `tcc_open()' opens a new file
and `tcc_close()' closes it. `inp()' returns the next character.

8.2 Lexer
=========

`next()' reads the next token in the current file. `next_nomacro()'
reads the next token without macro expansion.

   `tok' contains the current token (see `TOK_xxx') constants.
Identifiers and keywords are also keywords. `tokc' contains additional
infos about the token (for example a constant value if number or string
token).

8.3 Parser
==========

The parser is hardcoded (yacc is not necessary). It does only one pass,
except:

   * For initialized arrays with unknown size, a first pass is done to
     count the number of elements.

   * For architectures where arguments are evaluated in reverse order,
     a first pass is done to reverse the argument order.


8.4 Types
=========

The types are stored in a single 'int' variable. It was chosen in the
first stages of development when tcc was much simpler. Now, it may not
be the best solution.

     #define VT_INT        0  /* integer type */
     #define VT_BYTE       1  /* signed byte type */
     #define VT_SHORT      2  /* short type */
     #define VT_VOID       3  /* void type */
     #define VT_PTR        4  /* pointer */
     #define VT_ENUM       5  /* enum definition */
     #define VT_FUNC       6  /* function type */
     #define VT_STRUCT     7  /* struct/union definition */
     #define VT_FLOAT      8  /* IEEE float */
     #define VT_DOUBLE     9  /* IEEE double */
     #define VT_LDOUBLE   10  /* IEEE long double */
     #define VT_BOOL      11  /* ISOC99 boolean type */
     #define VT_LLONG     12  /* 64 bit integer */
     #define VT_LONG      13  /* long integer (NEVER USED as type, only
                                 during parsing) */
     #define VT_BTYPE      0x000f /* mask for basic type */
     #define VT_UNSIGNED   0x0010  /* unsigned type */
     #define VT_ARRAY      0x0020  /* array type (also has VT_PTR) */
     #define VT_VLA        0x20000 /* VLA type (also has VT_PTR and VT_ARRAY) */
     #define VT_BITFIELD   0x0040  /* bitfield modifier */
     #define VT_CONSTANT   0x0800  /* const modifier */
     #define VT_VOLATILE   0x1000  /* volatile modifier */
     #define VT_DEFSIGN    0x2000  /* signed type */

     #define VT_STRUCT_SHIFT 18   /* structure/enum name shift (14 bits left) */

   When a reference to another type is needed (for pointers, functions
and structures), the `32 - VT_STRUCT_SHIFT' high order bits are used to
store an identifier reference.

   The `VT_UNSIGNED' flag can be set for chars, shorts, ints and long
longs.

   Arrays are considered as pointers `VT_PTR' with the flag `VT_ARRAY'
set. Variable length arrays are considered as special arrays and have
flag `VT_VLA' set instead of `VT_ARRAY'.

   The `VT_BITFIELD' flag can be set for chars, shorts, ints and long
longs. If it is set, then the bitfield position is stored from bits
VT_STRUCT_SHIFT to VT_STRUCT_SHIFT + 5 and the bit field size is stored
from bits VT_STRUCT_SHIFT + 6 to VT_STRUCT_SHIFT + 11.

   `VT_LONG' is never used except during parsing.

   During parsing, the storage of an object is also stored in the type
integer:

     #define VT_EXTERN  0x00000080  /* extern definition */
     #define VT_STATIC  0x00000100  /* static variable */
     #define VT_TYPEDEF 0x00000200  /* typedef definition */
     #define VT_INLINE  0x00000400  /* inline definition */
     #define VT_IMPORT  0x00004000  /* win32: extern data imported from dll */
     #define VT_EXPORT  0x00008000  /* win32: data exported from dll */
     #define VT_WEAK    0x00010000  /* win32: data exported from dll */

8.5 Symbols
===========

All symbols are stored in hashed symbol stacks. Each symbol stack
contains `Sym' structures.

   `Sym.v' contains the symbol name (remember an idenfier is also a
token, so a string is never necessary to store it). `Sym.t' gives the
type of the symbol. `Sym.r' is usually the register in which the
corresponding variable is stored. `Sym.c' is usually a constant
associated to the symbol like its address for normal symbols, and the
number of entries for symbols representing arrays.  Variable length
array types use `Sym.c' as a location on the stack which holds the
runtime sizeof for the type.

   Four main symbol stacks are defined:

`define_stack'
     for the macros (`#define's).

`global_stack'
     for the global variables, functions and types.

`local_stack'
     for the local variables, functions and types.

`global_label_stack'
     for the local labels (for `goto').

`label_stack'
     for GCC block local labels (see the `__label__' keyword).


   `sym_push()' is used to add a new symbol in the local symbol stack.
If no local symbol stack is active, it is added in the global symbol
stack.

   `sym_pop(st,b)' pops symbols from the symbol stack ST until the
symbol B is on the top of stack. If B is NULL, the stack is emptied.

   `sym_find(v)' return the symbol associated to the identifier V. The
local stack is searched first from top to bottom, then the global stack.

8.6 Sections
============

The generated code and datas are written in sections. The structure
`Section' contains all the necessary information for a given section.
`new_section()' creates a new section. ELF file semantics is assumed
for each section.

   The following sections are predefined:

`text_section'
     is the section containing the generated code. IND contains the
     current position in the code section.

`data_section'
     contains initialized data

`bss_section'
     contains uninitialized data

`bounds_section'
`lbounds_section'
     are used when bound checking is activated

`stab_section'
`stabstr_section'
     are used when debugging is active to store debug information

`symtab_section'
`strtab_section'
     contain the exported symbols (currently only used for debugging).


8.7 Code generation
===================

8.7.1 Introduction
------------------

The TCC code generator directly generates linked binary code in one
pass. It is rather unusual these days (see gcc for example which
generates text assembly), but it can be very fast and surprisingly
little complicated.

   The TCC code generator is register based. Optimization is only done
at the expression level. No intermediate representation of expression is
kept except the current values stored in the _value stack_.

   On x86, three temporary registers are used. When more registers are
needed, one register is spilled into a new temporary variable on the
stack.

8.7.2 The value stack
---------------------

When an expression is parsed, its value is pushed on the value stack
(VSTACK). The top of the value stack is VTOP. Each value stack entry is
the structure `SValue'.

   `SValue.t' is the type. `SValue.r' indicates how the value is
currently stored in the generated code. It is usually a CPU register
index (`REG_xxx' constants), but additional values and flags are
defined:

     #define VT_CONST     0x00f0
     #define VT_LLOCAL    0x00f1
     #define VT_LOCAL     0x00f2
     #define VT_CMP       0x00f3
     #define VT_JMP       0x00f4
     #define VT_JMPI      0x00f5
     #define VT_LVAL      0x0100
     #define VT_SYM       0x0200
     #define VT_MUSTCAST  0x0400
     #define VT_MUSTBOUND 0x0800
     #define VT_BOUNDED   0x8000
     #define VT_LVAL_BYTE     0x1000
     #define VT_LVAL_SHORT    0x2000
     #define VT_LVAL_UNSIGNED 0x4000
     #define VT_LVAL_TYPE     (VT_LVAL_BYTE | VT_LVAL_SHORT | VT_LVAL_UNSIGNED)

`VT_CONST'
     indicates that the value is a constant. It is stored in the union
     `SValue.c', depending on its type.

`VT_LOCAL'
     indicates a local variable pointer at offset `SValue.c.i' in the
     stack.

`VT_CMP'
     indicates that the value is actually stored in the CPU flags (i.e.
     the value is the consequence of a test). The value is either 0 or
     1. The actual CPU flags used is indicated in `SValue.c.i'.

     If any code is generated which destroys the CPU flags, this value
     MUST be put in a normal register.

`VT_JMP'
`VT_JMPI'
     indicates that the value is the consequence of a conditional jump.
     For VT_JMP, it is 1 if the jump is taken, 0 otherwise. For VT_JMPI
     it is inverted.

     These values are used to compile the `||' and `&&' logical
     operators.

     If any code is generated, this value MUST be put in a normal
     register. Otherwise, the generated code won't be executed if the
     jump is taken.

`VT_LVAL'
     is a flag indicating that the value is actually an lvalue (left
     value of an assignment). It means that the value stored is
     actually a pointer to the wanted value.

     Understanding the use `VT_LVAL' is very important if you want to
     understand how TCC works.

`VT_LVAL_BYTE'
`VT_LVAL_SHORT'
`VT_LVAL_UNSIGNED'
     if the lvalue has an integer type, then these flags give its real
     type. The type alone is not enough in case of cast optimisations.

`VT_LLOCAL'
     is a saved lvalue on the stack. `VT_LVAL' must also be set with
     `VT_LLOCAL'. `VT_LLOCAL' can arise when a `VT_LVAL' in a register
     has to be saved to the stack, or it can come from an
     architecture-specific calling convention.

`VT_MUSTCAST'
     indicates that a cast to the value type must be performed if the
     value is used (lazy casting).

`VT_SYM'
     indicates that the symbol `SValue.sym' must be added to the
     constant.

`VT_MUSTBOUND'
`VT_BOUNDED'
     are only used for optional bound checking.


8.7.3 Manipulating the value stack
----------------------------------

`vsetc()' and `vset()' pushes a new value on the value stack. If the
previous VTOP was stored in a very unsafe place(for example in the CPU
flags), then some code is generated to put the previous VTOP in a safe
storage.

   `vpop()' pops VTOP. In some cases, it also generates cleanup code
(for example if stacked floating point registers are used as on x86).

   The `gv(rc)' function generates code to evaluate VTOP (the top value
of the stack) into registers. RC selects in which register class the
value should be put. `gv()' is the _most important function_ of the
code generator.

   `gv2()' is the same as `gv()' but for the top two stack entries.

8.7.4 CPU dependent code generation
-----------------------------------

See the `i386-gen.c' file to have an example.

`load()'
     must generate the code needed to load a stack value into a
     register.

`store()'
     must generate the code needed to store a register into a stack
     value lvalue.

`gfunc_start()'
`gfunc_param()'
`gfunc_call()'
     should generate a function call

`gfunc_prolog()'
`gfunc_epilog()'
     should generate a function prolog/epilog.

`gen_opi(op)'
     must generate the binary integer operation OP on the two top
     entries of the stack which are guaranted to contain integer types.

     The result value should be put on the stack.

`gen_opf(op)'
     same as `gen_opi()' for floating point operations. The two top
     entries of the stack are guaranted to contain floating point
     values of same types.

`gen_cvt_itof()'
     integer to floating point conversion.

`gen_cvt_ftoi()'
     floating point to integer conversion.

`gen_cvt_ftof()'
     floating point to floating point of different size conversion.

`gen_bounded_ptr_add()'

`gen_bounded_ptr_deref()'
     are only used for bounds checking.


8.8 Optimizations done
======================

Constant propagation is done for all operations. Multiplications and
divisions are optimized to shifts when appropriate. Comparison
operators are optimized by maintaining a special cache for the
processor flags. &&, || and ! are optimized by maintaining a special
'jump target' value. No other jump optimization is currently performed
because it would require to store the code in a more abstract fashion.
