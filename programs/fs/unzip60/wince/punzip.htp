<h3>Installing Pocket UnZip</h3>

<p>Place <strong>PUNZIP.EXE</strong> and <strong>PUNZIP.HTP </strong>(optional
help file) into your <strong>\Windows</strong> directory on your
H/PC.</p>

<p>From your H/PC's <strong>Start Menu</strong>, choose <strong>Run...</strong>,
enter &quot;<strong>punzip</strong>&quot;, and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p>The first time you run Pocket UnZip, it will register itself
as the application for handling Zip files. From then on, you can
just double-tap on Zip files in Explorer or from your Desktop to
open them in Pocket UnZip.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Opening a Zip File</h3>

<p>There are several ways to open a Zip file.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Double-tap on a Zip file in Windows CE Explorer or from
        your Windows CE desktop. </li>
    <li>From within Pocket UnZip, choose the <strong>Open...</strong>
        command from the <strong>File</strong> menu. You may also
        tap the <strong>Open</strong> toolbar button or press <strong>Ctrl+O</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>Pocket UnZip keeps track of the four most recently opened
        Zip files. You may quickly open one of these recent files
        by selecting the Zip file directly from Pocket UnZip's <strong>File</strong>
        menu.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Zip File Listing</h3>

<p>Pocket UnZip's main view displays a list of files,
directories, and volume labels that are stored within the
currently loaded Zip file. This list can be displayed in two
modes, normal and expanded. The normal mode is sufficient for
most users. It contains the following information for every item
in the Zip file:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong>: Name and path of the compressed
        file, directory, or volume label.</li>
    <li><strong>Size</strong>: Size, in bytes, that the item
        requires when uncompressed.</li>
    <li><strong>Type</strong>: Type of item.</li>
    <li><strong>Modified</strong>: Date and time that the item
        was last modified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expanded mode contains all the above information, plus the
following additional information:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Attributes of the item.
        <ul>
            <li><font face="Courier New"><strong>V</strong></font>:
                Volume label</li>
            <li><font face="Courier New"><strong>D</strong></font>:
                Directory</li>
            <li><font face="Courier New"><strong>R</strong></font>:
                Read-only file</li>
            <li><font face="Courier New"><strong>A</strong></font>:
                Archive file</li>
            <li><font face="Courier New"><strong>H</strong></font>:
                Hidden file</li>
            <li><font face="Courier New"><strong>S</strong></font>:
                System file</li>
            <li><font face="Courier New"><strong>E</strong></font>:
                Encrypted (this file will require a password)</li>
            <li><font face="Courier New"><strong>C</strong></font>:
                Comment (this item has a comment)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Compressed</strong>: Compressed size, in bytes,
        of the item.</li>
    <li><strong>Ratio</strong>: Compression ratio of the item.</li>
    <li><strong>Method</strong>: Compression method used to
        compress the item.</li>
    <li><strong>CRC</strong>: 32 bit Cyclic Redundancy Check
        signature of the item.</li>
    <li><strong>Comment</strong>: Optional comment string that
        was associated with the item when compressed.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may toggle between the normal view and the expanded view
by selecting the <strong>Extended View</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong>
menu, or by tapping the associated toolbar button.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Properties Dialog</h3>

<p>The properties dialog is useful for viewing detailed
information for one or more files. It is invoked by selecting one
or more files in the file list and then choosing <strong>Properties</strong>
from the <strong>File</strong> menu. For convenience, you can
also tap the toolbar button or press <strong>Alt+Enter</strong>.</p>

<p>If one file is selected, the properties dialog will show you
detailed information about that one file and its comment.</p>

<p>If multiple files are selected, the dialog will show you
combined results for all the files selected. Cumulative results
will be given for the file count, byte counts, and compression
ratio. Merged results will be given for the compression method,
date, CRC, attributes, and comment. For the date, all values that
are common between the selected files (such as year), will be
shown with their common value. All values that differ between the
selected files will be shown as question marks. For attributes, a
black check means that all selected files have that particular
attribute, a gray check mark means that some of the selected
files have that attribute, and no check mark means that none of
the selected files have that attribute.</p>

<p>By using the properties dialog with multiple files, you can
determine things like... What is the total number of files or
bytes in the Zip file? What is the total compression ratio for
all selected files. Are all the selected files from the same
year? Same month? How many files have comments?</p>

<hr>
<h3>File Comments</h3>

<p>Zip files provide two levels of commenting. At compression
time, users can add per-file comments, as well as one main
comment for the entire Zip file. The per-file comments are
usually used to give a short description of each file. The main
comment is usually used for credits, copyright information,
installation instructions, version numbers, etc. Pocket UnZip
can display both types of comments. </p>

<p>Per-file comments can be viewed in Comments column of the main
file list while in expanded mode (see the <strong>Zip File Listing</strong>
section) and also in the properties dialog (see the <strong>Properties
Dialog</strong> section).</p>

<p>The main Zip file comment can be viewed by selecting <strong>Zip
File Comment</strong> from the <strong>View</strong> menu or by
pressing the associated toolbar button. This option will be
disabled if the Zip file does not contain a main comment.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Extracting Files</h3>

<p>Once you have opened a Zip file into Pocket UnZip, you should
see a list of the Zip file's contents. Select one or more files
from the file list and then choose <strong>Extract Selected Files</strong>
(<strong>Ctrl+E</strong>) or <strong>Extract All Files</strong> (<strong>Ctrl+A</strong>,
<strong>Ctrl+E</strong>) from the <strong>Action</strong> menu. You may
also use the noted shortcut keys or the associated toolbar
buttons.</p>

<p>An extract options dialog will appear showing you some
statistics about the files you are about to extract and prompting
you for some information. There are three options available to
you.</p>

<p>The <strong>Restore file paths</strong> option allows you to
control whether the directory structure of the files you have
selected to extract will be preserved. When this option is
checked, any directory paths associated with the compressed files
will be created, and the file will be extracted to the newly
created directory. If this option is not checked, all files will
be extracted to a single directory, regardless of any path
information associated with the compressed files.</p>

<p>The <strong>Overwrite Options</strong> allow you to tell
Pocket UnZip what to do if a file already exists on your file
system with the same name of a file that is about to be
extracted. The choices are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Prompt to overwrite</strong>: Causes a dialog to
        appear for every situation that involves possibly
        overwriting a file. This allows you to decide what files
        get overwritten on a file-by-file basis. </li>
    <li><strong>Overwrite if newer</strong>: Causes Pocket UnZip
        to automatically overwrite any files that have a date and
        time that is earlier then the date and time of the file
        being extracted. This option can be useful for updating
        files. </li>
    <li><strong>Always overwrite</strong>: Causes Pocket UnZip to
        always automatically overwrite any files without
        prompting or warning. Use with caution. </li>
    <li><strong>Never overwrite</strong>: Causes Pocket UnZip to
        automatically skip all files that already exist on the
        file system.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Extract To</strong> field specifies the root
directory that should be used to extract files to. If you checked
the <strong>Restore file paths</strong> option, then any
directories associated with the files being extracted will be
created under the directory specified in this field. The
directory you enter must already exist. To create directories and
browse for directories, use the <strong>Browse...</strong>
button.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen the options you wish to use, press the <strong>Extract</strong>
button. A progress dialog will appear and the extraction will
begin. At any time during the extraction, you may tap the <strong>Abort</strong>
button to abort the extraction operation.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Aborting the
extraction operation while processing a file will likely cause a
partial file to get extracted and saved.</strong></p>

<p>During the extraction, you may get interrupted for one of
three reasons. First, if an error occurs, you will be notified
with a message box. Second, if you have chosen the <strong>Prompt
to overwrite</strong> option and you are trying to extract a file
that already exists, you will be prompted on how to handle the
situation. Third, if a file being extracted is encrypted, then
you will be prompted for that file's password (see the <strong>Encrypted
Files</strong> section).</p>

<p>Once the extraction is complete, the <strong>Abort</strong>
button will change to a <strong>Close</strong> button and any
errors or warnings will be displayed. Tap the <strong>Close</strong>
button to return to Pocket UnZip's main screen.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Testing Files</h3>

<p>Testing files is essentially the same as extracting files,
except for that the actual extracted data is never written to
your file system. Testing files is useful when you wish to verify
the integrity of a Zip file without actually extracting the files
within it.</p>

<p>Once you have opened a Zip file into Pocket UnZip, you should
see a list of the Zip file's contents. Select one or more files
from the file list and then choose <strong>Test Selected Files</strong>
(<strong>Ctrl+T</strong>) or <strong>Test All Files</strong> (<strong>Ctrl+A</strong>,
<strong>Ctrl+T</strong>) from the <strong>Action</strong> menu. You may
also use the noted shortcut keys or the associated toolbar
buttons.</p>

<p>A progress dialog will appear and the testing will begin. At
any time during the testing, you may tap the <strong>Abort</strong>
button to abort the testing operation.</p>

<p>During the testing, you may get interrupted for one of two
reasons. First, if an error occurs, you will be notified with a
message box. Second, if a file being tested is encrypted, then
you will be prompted for that file's password (see the <strong>Encrypted
Files</strong> section).</p>

<p>Once the testing is complete, the <strong>Abort</strong>
button will change to a <strong>Close</strong> button and any
errors or warnings will be displayed. Tap the <strong>Close</strong>
button to return to Pocket UnZip's main screen.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Viewing Files</h3>

<p>Pocket UnZip provides the ability to view, or even execute,
files directly from a Zip file. This feature is a major
convenience over having to extract and then manually open each
file you wish to view. Internally, this is what Pocket UnZip is
doing for you, but it takes care of all the work of extracting
the file to a temporary directory, launching the associated
viewer for that file type, and cleaning up when done.</p>

<p>To view a file, simply select a single file from Pocket
UnZip's main file list and press <strong>Enter</strong>. You may also
choose <strong>View Selected File</strong> from the <strong>Action</strong>
menu, press the associated toolbar button, or just double-tap on
the file you wish to view.</p>

<p>The file will be extracted to a directory called<strong>
Temporary Pocket UnZip Files</strong> in the root of your file
system. If the file you wish to view is encrypted, you will be
prompted for a password. If the file has an associated viewer
application installed (such as Pocket Word for .PWD files), then
that viewer will automatically be launched with the newly
extracted file as its command line. If there is no associated
viewer application, then you will be prompted for the application
you wish to use to view the file.</p>

<p>Pocket UnZip also provides minimal support for allowing you to
use the view file action to run executable programs directly from
the Zip file. If the file you choose to view is an executable
(file extension is EXE), then the file will be executed after it
is extracted. Pocket UnZip will only extract the file you select
and none of its dependent files (like DLLs). If the executable
you extract depends on other files in the Zip file, it will most
likely fail to execute.</p>

<p>When Pocket UnZip exits, it will delete the <strong>Temporary
Pocket UnZip Files</strong> directory and all the files in it. If
you are running more than one instance of Pocket UnZip, then only
the last instance of Pocket UnZip that you exit will perform this
delete. Most applications, such as Pocket Word, lock files when
viewing them. Any files being viewed by such an application when
you exit Pocket UnZip will not be deleted.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Encrypted Files</h3>

<p>If an encrypted file is encountered during an extract, test,
or view operation, you will be prompted for a password. You can
choose to skip the file, skip all encrypted files, or enter a
password. You will be given three attempts at entering the
correct password before the file will be skipped automatically.
Once you have entered the correct password for a given file, that
password will be remembered and automatically used for all other
encrypted files that are encountered during that single extract,
test, or view operation. If another encrypted file is found that
uses a different password than the remembered password, then you
will be prompted again for a new password.</p>

<p>This technique provides support for multi-password Zip files,
while still providing users with single password Zip files the
convenience of only having to enter their password once during
the operation for all encrypted files. For security reasons,
passwords are not remembered after the operation completes.</p>
