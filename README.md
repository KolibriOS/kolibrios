KolibriOS is a hobby operating system for x86-compatible computers, which is currently being developed by a small but passionate team of enthusiasts.

Its kernel, most drivers, and many programs are written entirely in [FASM](https://flatassembler.net/) assembly language, making them very compact and lean on system resources.

Based on [MenuetOS](https://www.menuetos.net/), it uses its own standards and is NOT fully POSIX or UNIX compliant.
